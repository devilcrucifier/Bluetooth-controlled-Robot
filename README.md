# Bluetooth-controlled-Robot
This was a hobby project built for the purpose of a workshop. In this project I have used the Arduino Microcontroller to control a Bluetooth module. The Bluetooth module is used to control the DC motors using L293D motor driver IC. The L293D motor driver could control 2 DC motors at once.
